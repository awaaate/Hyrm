Check if heartbeat service has the correct agent_id of current orchestrator\n3. Confirm heartbeat loop is executing every 60s or if it's being interrupted\n4. Verify file permissions on memory/orchestrator-state.json\n5. Check if the issue is missing agent_id in heartbeat service startup\n\nPattern observed:\n- Heartbeat service starts (PID 100192 at 16:58:11Z)\n- Leader expires exactly 240-250s later (16:58:07 + 240s = 16:59:47Z expected ~17:04:07Z actual)\n- Watchdog detects and respawns orchestrator\n- New orchestrator takes over with fresh epoch\n- Pattern repeats\n\nThis is the root cause of frequent orchestrator respawns (~2/hour instead of 0-1/hour target).\n\nSuccess criteria:\n- Leader lease remains valid for >180s (within TTL)\n- No more stale leader warnings in realtime.log\n- Orchestrator restarts drop to <1/hour",
