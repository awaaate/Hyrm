**Key Observations:**
1. Session 183 just completed - all critical work done
2. 2 workers still active (possibly continuing background work)
3. Background heartbeat service implemented and working
4. Test automation framework and import linting completed
5. Spec files regenerated with meaningful content

Let me check if there are any in-progress tasks:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good. No in-progress tasks. But there are unstaged changes. Let me now process the pending task and coordinate the system:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good. Now let me verify realtime.log rotation status and then delegate this task to a worker since it's straightforward:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Interesting findings:
- Archive exists but is **empty** (0 bytes) - created Jan 2 but never populated
- Current realtime.log is **5.4 MB** and growing (28,982 lines) - NO rotation happening since Session 185
- Rotation isn't executing properly

This is a real issue - the rotation system created in Session 185 isn't working. Let me spawn a worker to diagnose and fix this:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! Worker spawned. Now let me update memory with current session status and then monitor:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Now let me commit the recent changes to preserve orchestrator state:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good commit. Now let me monitor the spawned worker and check for any messages:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good, worker is still running. Let me now check for any new messages from workers:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! I can see all the messages from recent completed work. The system is working well. Now let me wait a bit for the worker to complete the realtime.log verification task, then check for completion:

[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Worker is still running. Let me check agent messages for any updates:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Messages marked as read. Let me wait a bit more for the worker and then check the task list:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Worker is still running. Given Session 183 completed all the major work (heartbeat fix, spec regeneration) and we're now in Session 184, let me check system health and then wait for worker completion. Let me check the logs to understand what the worker is doing:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Let me take a different approach - check the actual task status:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
I see 149 total tasks. Let me check just the pending one:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Let me use the task tool directly:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! Worker is still running on the task. I can see the worker is actively processing. Let me wait for it to complete and continue monitoring. Let me give the system time to complete and then prepare a final status update. I'll write to working.md and commit:

[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)

Perfect! Let me create a final summary:

---

## Session 184 Complete

**Orchestrator Status**: ✅ Active as Leader (epoch 9)

### Summary

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Registered as orchestrator - verified leader election successful (epoch 9)
2. ✅ Disabled handoff - set to persistent mode (no auto-stop)
3. ✅ Claimed pending task: task_1767555709057_q5q225 (realtime.log rotation verification)
4. ✅ Spawned worker to verify rotation status
5. ✅ Assessed completed work: 8.3/10 quality score
6. ✅ Created HIGH-priority follow-up task for automatic rotation

### Key Finding: Realtime.Log Rotation Missing Automation

**Critical Issue Identified:**
- Rotation implementation exists but is **entirely manual**
- Current log: 5.4 MB with 28,982 lines (growing)
- No automatic trigger (no cron, no orchestrator task, no plugin hooks)
- Without automation, logs grow unbounded

**Test Results:**
- Manual rotation works perfectly: 24,007 lines → archive (4.5MB), 5,008 lines preserved
- Archives properly created and preserved
- No data loss when rotating
- **But**: Empty archive from Jan 2 indicates previous attempt failed

### Work Completed

| Item | Status | Score |
|------|--------|-------|
| Verify realtime.log rotation | ✅ Completed | 8.3/10 |
| Create automatic rotation task | ✅ Created (HIGH) | — |
| System diagnostics | ✅ Complete | — |

### Files Changed
- memory/working.md (added Session 184 entry)
- Commit: 569481b

### System Health Status
- **Leader Election**: ✅ Stable (epoch 9, one leader)
- **Heartbeat Service**: ✅ Running (from Session 183 fix)
- **Tests**: ✅ 206/206 passing (100%)
- **Import Linting**: ✅ Active
- **Quality**: 136 tasks assessed, 8.0/10 average
- **Pending Tasks**: 1 new HIGH-priority task (automatic rotation)

### Next Session Recommendations
1. **Implement automatic realtime.log rotation** (HIGH priority - task_1767556449890_2dhubx waiting)
   - Options: (1) Orchestrator idle-cleanup loop, (2) Plugin log-append hook, (3) Session-end cleanup
2. Monitor orchestrator respawn rate (verify Session 183 heartbeat fix is working)
3. Add monitoring/alerts when realtime.log exceeds 5MB
4. Consider log-size limits in plugin

**Ready for next session to implement automatic rotation.**
