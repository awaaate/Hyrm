The heartbeat shows the worker agent is still active. Let me wait a moment and check again - the completion message may be in flight.

I see heartbeat logs but no task completion yet. The archive compression worker is probably still working. Let me check if there are any newer messages or if the task status has changed.

The archive compression task is in progress. The worker is still running. Let me check on active agents to see the worker status.

Good! I can see agent-1767720812695-7ydzdi (code-worker) is actively working on the archive compression task (heartbeat at 17:33:37). The agent is working but hasn't sent a completion message yet. Let me wait a bit longer and check periodically.

Good! The worker is still running (PID 186552) and is processing the archive compression. The process is taking some time, which is expected for compression work. Let me monitor for the completion message more actively.

The message bus is holding at 50 lines, which suggests the worker is still running but hasn't completed yet. Let me check the task status and worker status directly rather than monitoring the message bus.

The worker is still running (PID 186552 exists). The archive compression task is taking longer than expected - this is normal for compression work on multiple files. The worker will send a completion message when finished. Let me continue monitoring the system and prepare for the completion while the worker operates in the background.

Let me check the task status and prepare for quality assessment once the worker completes.

The task is still in "pending" status. The worker must be in the process of claiming it and starting work. Let me check the agent messages one more time to see if there's a task_claim or newer messages.

The messages show heartbeats and broadcasts from workers, but no task_claim or task_complete yet. The worker process (PID 186552) is still running. It's likely the worker session is still initializing or working on the task. Let me wait a bit more and check the realtime log for progress.

No progress logs visible yet. The worker is running in the background and may be still initializing. This is normal - it can take 20-30 seconds for a new worker session to start. Let me continue monitoring and give it more time.

Since the archive compression worker is running asynchronously, I should continue my coordinator duties and set up for the completion monitoring. Let me check if there are any other system health issues or improvements I should be making while the worker operates.

Good! System status shows 1 pending task (archive compression) with 4 agents active. Let me check the agents view to see the worker status more clearly.

Perfect! I can see the worker agent-1767720812695-7ydzdi is listed as "working" on the archive compression task (heartbeat 58s ago). The worker is active and processing. Let me monitor a bit more actively by checking if there are new session logs for the worker.

The sessions directory shows old sessions. Let me check what the worker actually logged by looking for the session ID or checking the opencode sessions file.

The sessions file seems to have parsing issues. Let me just wait for the completion and check agent messages periodically. The worker is actively running, so it will send a completion message when done.

Let me use a more targeted approach - wait a bit longer and then check for the next message batch.

The worker is still processing. This is normal for archive compression work - it could take several minutes depending on the file sizes and compression efficiency. Rather than blocking, let me continue with other orchestrator duties and set up monitoring for when the worker completes.

Let me check if there are any other system improvements I should be making while the worker operates, or if the system is stable enough for a monitoring pattern.

Good system status. The system has achieved excellent results across multiple sessions. Let me now update working memory with the current session progress and then establish a monitoring loop for the worker completion.
