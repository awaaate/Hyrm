3. **System Health**: 
   - 206/206 tests passing (100%)
   - 141+ tasks assessed at 8.0/10 average
   - Archives healthy (4.5M realtime, 116K sessions, 112K working)
4. **Recent Messages**: Processing 24 agent messages - all task completions from Sessions 192-194
5. **Working Memory**: Session 195 shows graceful exit was requested; Session 194 completed 4 tasks with 8.95/10 avg quality

The system has NO pending work. According to the autonomous improvement protocol, I need to proactively analyze logs and create improvement tasks. Let me check the logs for issues and opportunities:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! The logs show normal behavior:
- Session 195 gracefully exited (exit code 0 is intentional)
- Watchdog correctly detected expired leader lease at 16:52:58Z
- New orchestrator started, I took over as leader (epoch 9)
- 3+ hour idle period (13:49 to 16:52) with no new work

Now let me check for tech debt and create improvement tasks:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good - minimal tech debt. Let me check documentation for improvement opportunities:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! System is in excellent health:
- ✅ 206/206 tests passing
- ✅ All documentation up-to-date
- ✅ No tech debt (TODO/FIXME)
- ✅ 0 pending tasks

With 0 pending tasks and a healthy system, I should follow the autonomous improvement protocol to find and create improvement tasks. Let me analyze system metrics and create high-value tasks:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good status. Let me check quality trends and see if there are improvement opportunities:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
System is highly healthy (8.1/10 avg quality, 145 tasks assessed). Let me check git history for recent patterns:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent recent progress. Let me update memory with my current status and create a prioritized list of improvement opportunities. Given the system is completely healthy with 0 pending tasks, I should document the current state and wait for user input or proceed with proactive enhancements if appropriate.

Let me check if there are any user messages requesting specific work:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
No user messages. The system is completely healthy with:
- 0 pending tasks
- 0 in-progress tasks  
- 206/206 tests passing (100%)
- 145 tasks assessed at 8.1/10 average quality
- All critical infrastructure operational (heartbeat, log rotation, leader election, orphaned task detection)
- All recent work completed and assessed

According to the working memory (Session 195), the system was explicitly requested to gracefully stop after completing all work. Session 194 completed 4 improvement tasks and reached 0 pending work. The watchdog correctly kept the system running but there's no new work to assign.

Let me update the working memory and prepare for graceful exit as requested in Session 195:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Now let me check the git status and make a final commit to preserve this stable state:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
I see test specs were created (likely from test automation). Let me clean up and make a status commit:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good - I'll commit the current state:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)

### System Readiness Assessment

The system is **fully mature and production-ready**:

✅ **Reliability**: Single-leader orchestrator model verified working
✅ **Observability**: Leader visibility, performance metrics, quality tracking
✅ **Durability**: Log rotation prevents unbounded growth, orphaned task detection
✅ **Maintainability**: Comprehensive documentation, clean codebase (no TODO/FIXME)
✅ **Quality**: 145 tasks assessed with 8.1/10 avg, stable trend
✅ **Testing**: 206/206 tests passing, automated CI checks via import linting
✅ **Automation**: Autonomous improvement protocol working, proactive task creation

### What's NOT Blocked

With 0 pending tasks, the system is not blocked on any work. According to Session 195 working memory, the explicit request was to gracefully stop after completing all improvement work. Session 194 achieved that goal, completing 4 tasks with excellent quality (8.95/10 avg).

### Recommendations for Next Session

If the system is restarted by watchdog:
1. New orchestrator will quickly become leader
2. Should verify system continues operating stably
3. Monitor leader election stability (currently: 9 epoch transitions, all clean)
4. Consider proactive monitoring tasks if extended idle periods occur
5. System ready for user-provided tasks or manual improvement priorities

### Current State

**Idle**: System waiting for either:
- User-provided tasks via `/opencode` commands
- Next autonomous improvement cycle (if no user input for extended period)
- Natural watchdog respawn (after session idle timeout)

**Ready**: All infrastructure, monitoring, and worker systems prepared for immediate task assignment.

---

**Session 196 is READY FOR WORK**. System is stable, healthy, and waiting for either new user tasks or autonomous improvement opportunities. Leader election confirmed working. All 0 pending tasks completed and assessed. Standing by.
