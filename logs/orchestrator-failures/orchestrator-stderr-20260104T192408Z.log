      "description": "memory/realtime.log shows session.error with 401 ‘OAuth token has expired’. Add a guardrail: detect auth failures, mark system status as blocked/degraded, pause expensive loops, and emit a clear operator action message (refresh token) instead of cascading failures.\n\nSuccess criteria:\n- On 401, orchestrator remains healthy and stops retry storms\n- A single clear error status is recorded (state + logs) with recovery steps",
