Non-blocking implementation ensures zero impact on watchdog reliability. Threshold-based approach (500MB) is good preventative strategy. Monitoring growth rate (5KB/day) gives 40+ day runway before compression becomes necessary. This pattern (rotation + compression) is now established as best practice for log management infrastructure.\""}
