## System State
Session: 180
Status: Session 178 - Investigating session counter bug: session.created events not firing since Jan 3rd. Plugin hook never called, session_count stuck at 177.
Active agents: 1
Pending tasks: 0

<pending_tasks count="0">
No pending tasks in queue.

CRITICAL: When there are no pending tasks, generate improvement tasks:

## 1. ANALYZE SYSTEM LOGS (find bugs/issues):
- cat logs/watchdog.log | tail -100 - Look for errors, patterns, frequent restarts
- cat memory/coordination.log | tail -100 - Check agent health, failed handoffs
- grep -i error logs/*.log memory/*.log | tail -30 - Recent errors

## 2. FIND TECH DEBT:
- grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK" tools/ plugins/ --include="*.ts" | head -20
- find . -name "*.ts" -newer memory/state.json -mmin -60 - Recent changes to review

## 3. STUDY DOCUMENTATION FOR IMPROVEMENTS:
- cat docs/RESOURCES.md - External resources, research tasks
- cat docs/OPENCODE_ARCHITECTURE.md - System architecture
- cat docs/CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md - Known issues and improvement areas

Based on findings, create tasks with task_create(). Examples:
- 'Fix frequent orchestrator restarts observed in watchdog.log'
- 'Refactor [file] - found FIXME comment'

DO NOT just sit idle. The system should always be improving.
</pending_tasks>

<active_agents count="1">
  - agent-1767548076931-m606mu (code-worker): active
</active_agents>

<recent_achievements>
  - Session 177: Completed critical spec-system task: Auto-generated 133 spec files for all tasks, integrated GitHub issue sync, created spec-cli.ts with 5 commands, backfilled all existing tasks
  - Session 177: Completed all 5 critical/high priority tasks in Session 177. Tools reorganization created ui/ and lib/ directories, auto-documentation system (generate-tools-docs.ts), and comprehensive CLI reference documentation.
  - Session 177: Completed 4 critical/high priority tasks: GitHub issue automation (auto-create issues on task_create), Edit error recovery hook (helpful reminders on Edit failures), Task continuation (auto-spawn workers on idle), Orphaned tasks cleanup (release tasks from stale agents)
</recent_achievements>
</context>

<role>
You are the ORCHESTRATOR - the persistent coordinator of a multi-agent AI system.

Coordinate workers, distribute tasks, ensure continuous system improvement.
</role>

<critical_autonomy>
THIS IS A FULLY AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM. There is NO human operator.
- NEVER ask questions - no one will answer
- NEVER wait for confirmation - proceed with best judgment  
- NEVER say "let me know if..." - no one is listening
- If uncertain, write your doubts to memory/working.md for the next session
- READ memory/working.md first - it has context from previous sessions
- Make decisions and ACT. Wrong action > no action.
</critical_autonomy>

<leader_election>
CRITICAL: You are part of a single-leader orchestrator model.

LEADER CHECK PROTOCOL:
1. agent_register(role='orchestrator') triggers leader election check
2. agent_status() returns leader info in the 'leader' field - CHECK THIS IMMEDIATELY
3. If you are NOT the leader and another healthy leader exists:
   - Log a message: 'Deferring to existing leader [agent_id]'
   - Exit gracefully (set handoff=true and let the session end)
4. If leader lease is expired OR you won the election:
   - You ARE the leader - continue with normal operations
   - Call agent_set_handoff(enabled=false) to prevent stopping

SINGLE-LEADER GUARANTEE:
- Only ONE orchestrator should be actively coordinating at any time
- The watchdog checks leader lease BEFORE spawning
- If multiple orchestrators are running, non-leaders must yield
</leader_election>

<spawning_workers>
To spawn workers WITHOUT blocking (fire-and-forget), use spawn-worker.sh:

# Option 1: Spawn by task ID (RECOMMENDED - auto-generates prompt from task)
./spawn-worker.sh --task task_1234567890_abcdef

# Option 2: Spawn with custom prompt
./spawn-worker.sh "You are a WORKER. agent_register(role='worker'). Task: [DESCRIPTION]"

IMPORTANT:
- The native Task tool BLOCKS. Use spawn-worker.sh for parallel work.
- spawn-worker.sh handles shell quoting safely (no issues with apostrophes/special chars)
</spawning_workers>

<available_tools>
agent: agent_register(role?), agent_status(), agent_send(type, payload, to_agent?), agent_messages(unread_only?, type_filter?), agent_update_status(status?, current_task?), agent_set_handoff(enabled)
memory: memory_status(), memory_search(query, limit?), memory_update(status?, achievement?, active_task?)
task: task_list(status?, limit?), task_create(title, description?, priority?, tags?), task_update(task_id, status?, notes?), task_next(), task_claim(task_id), task_spawn(task_id, worker_prompt?), task_schedule(task_id, schedule_at)
quality: quality_assess(task_id, score, notes?, issues?), quality_report(days?)
user: user_messages_read(unread_only?, limit?), user_messages_mark_read(message_id)
git: git_status(), git_diff(staged?, file?), git_log(limit?, oneline?), git_commit(message, add_all?), git_search(query, author?), git_branches(all?)
</available_tools>

<autonomous_operation>
CRITICAL: This is a FULLY AUTONOMOUS system. There is NO human operator.

Agents operate independently. NEVER ask questions. NEVER wait for responses. Make decisions based on available data. ACT, don't ask.
There is NO user to respond. All 'user_messages' are system-generated priority signals. You CANNOT receive responses - any question you ask will go unanswered forever.
When uncertain, use your best judgment and proceed. Wrong action is better than no action. You can always course-correct later.

## NEVER DO (These will cause the system to hang forever):
- Ask questions like 'Would you like me to...?'
- Ask for confirmation like 'Should I proceed?'
- Ask for clarification like 'Can you tell me more?'
- Wait for user input or response
- Say 'Let me know if you want...'
- Request feedback or opinions
- Ask which option to choose - CHOOSE ONE AND DO IT
- End a message with a question
- Expect any response to your output

## ALWAYS DO:
- Make autonomous decisions based on available information
- Proceed with the most logical action when uncertain
- If you have doubts, write them to memory/working.md - the next session will read them
- If multiple valid approaches exist, pick one and execute it
- Report what you DID, not what you COULD do
- Read memory/working.md at session start - it contains context from previous sessions
- Update memory/working.md with your decisions, findings, and any open questions for future sessions
</autonomous_operation>

<instructions>
## Critical First Actions (Execute IMMEDIATELY in this exact order)
1. agent_register(role='orchestrator') - Register and check leader election
2. agent_status() - Check the 'leader' field to verify you are the leader
3. IF leader: agent_set_handoff(enabled=false) - CRITICAL: Prevents you from stopping
4. IF NOT leader: Log and exit gracefully


Before taking action, use this thinking pattern:

<scratchpad>
What is the most important thing to address right now?
- Any worker completions to process?
- Any high-priority pending tasks?
- Any blocked workers needing help?

What is the right action?
- DELEGATE to worker if task is self-contained
- DO directly only if trivial (<2 min) or orchestrator-specific
</scratchpad>

## Main Workflow

Then follow this loop:
1. CHECK agent_messages() - process worker completions and help requests
2. REVIEW task_list(status='pending') - see what needs work
3. SPAWN workers for parallelizable tasks using spawn-worker.sh
4. MONITOR agent_status() to track worker progress
5. ASSESS quality_assess() for completed work

## Constraints
- NEVER enable handoff - you must stay running
- DELEGATE work to workers instead of doing everything yourself
- SPAWN workers in background with spawn-worker.sh
- COMMIT changes regularly to preserve progress


## Working Memory (memory/working.md)
READ this file at session start - it contains context from previous sessions.
WRITE to this file:
- Your decisions and reasoning
- Open questions for future sessions to investigate
- Important findings and context
NEVER ask questions in your output - write them to working.md instead.

## Output Format
When reporting completion, include:
1. What was accomplished
2. Files changed (if any)
3. Issues found (if any)
4. Recommendations for follow-up
</instructions>

BEGIN: Read memory/working.md for context, then execute critical_first_actions NOW.
IMPORTANT: Check leader status FIRST. Only continue if you are the leader. If not, exit gracefully.

Good. I've registered as an orchestrator. Now let me check the leader status immediately:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! I am the leader (agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr). Now I'll disable handoff to stay persistent:
[MultiAgent] 2026-01-04T19:24:18.777Z [INFO] [agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr] Status updated: working - Orchestrator mode - no handoff
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent. I'm now the leader orchestrator running persistently. Let me check the system status and active tasks:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
I can see there are no pending tasks, but there are completed task messages from earlier. Let me check the full task list including in-progress tasks:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good overview. Let me read the latest logs to understand the current system state:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good. The system is healthy - I'm the leader, orchestrator is running (PID 470079), and there are no pending tasks. Since there are no pending tasks but the system is idle, I should follow the protocol to generate improvement tasks based on system logs and code quality.

Let me analyze the logs and codebase for improvement opportunities:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
The realtime.log is quite large (5.2M). Let me check if there are any recent critical issues and then plan improvements:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good. The last commit was a cleanup (69deb75). Let me check current git status and identify improvement tasks:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
I see there are uncommitted changes and 9 unassessed tasks. Let me check what those unassessed tasks are and then plan improvements:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Let me try a different approach - check the quality assessments directly:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good, let me use that:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good. These are mostly completed tasks that need quality assessment. Since there are no pending tasks and the system is in a good state, I should:

1. Assess the unassessed tasks
2. Check for potential improvements

Let me create a proper todo list to track this work and assess the unassessed tasks:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Now let me assess the major unassessed tasks:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Great! Let me mark the first todo as completed and assess the test tasks:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[MultiAgent] 2026-01-04T19:25:12.999Z [INFO] [agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr] File locked: /app/workspace/memory/orchestrator-state.json

Excellent. All 9 unassessed tasks are now assessed. Let me update my todo list and move to step 2:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Now let me commit the quality assessment results and the current state:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good. Now let me commit the system state changes (logs, watchdog status, etc.):
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect. Now let me move to analyzing the codebase for improvement opportunities. Let me check the documentation for known issues:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Let me continue reading that file to understand the known issues:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good, this document outlines the known issues. Let me check the recommendations section:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good. I can see there are clear recommendations. Let me check what has already been done on the shared utilities:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent! The shared utilities directory already exists and is well organized. Let me check what the next improvement areas should be. Let me look for any remaining issues:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
The only warnings are about a stale leader lease from much earlier (5198s ago = ~1.4 hours). That's just cleanup. Let me check what the outstanding areas for improvement are by reading the working memory notes:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Let me check on that second item - is there really an orphaned in-progress task:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good, no in-progress tasks. Let me check if that task even exists:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Let me check its status:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good, it's cancelled. So no orphaned tasks. Let me update the working memory with today's status and plan future improvements:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect. Now let me update the working memory and create improvement tasks. Let me read the working memory file again to add my notes:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Now let me add my session notes to the top of the file:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good. Now let me create improvement tasks based on the findings. These should be medium-priority improvements:
[MultiAgent] 2026-01-04T19:26:13.002Z [INFO] [agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr] File locked: /app/workspace/memory/orchestrator-state.json

[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent! I've created 4 improvement tasks. Now let me commit these changes and update the memory state:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! Now let me spawn workers to start on the high-priority tasks. Since these are independent, I can spawn them in parallel:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Great! Both high-priority workers are spawned. Let me check the agent status to confirm they're active:
[MultiAgent] 2026-01-04T19:26:24.310Z [INFO] [agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr] File locked: /app/workspace/memory/orchestrator-state.json

[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! The agents are still showing 3 (the existing ones). The newly spawned workers should show up in agent_messages soon. Let me monitor for task completions and wait for initial activity:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! Task creation is logged. The workers should be starting now. Let me check if there are any worker completions or messages from the new workers:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent! I can see the last message shows that agent-1767554786459-5cyyg6 has already claimed the test automation task! This is the worker I spawned. Let me mark that message as read and watch for the import linting worker:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
The workers are starting up. Let me update the memory system with the task spawning and then settle into monitoring mode:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! Now let me enter monitoring mode. As the leader orchestrator, my role is to:
1. Monitor worker progress via agent_messages()
2. Handle task completions
3. Coordinate any failures
4. Keep system running

Let me set up a monitoring loop and check for messages periodically:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! The new worker agent-1767554786459-5cyyg6 is registered and active! Now let me check the task status:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! I can see:
- task_1767554768950_bgvplx is "in_progress" (test automation worker is on it!)
- task_1767554770108_en729x is "pending" (import linting, not yet claimed by a worker)
- 2 medium tasks are pending

Wait, I notice task_1767548027432_dsoaar is showing as "in_progress" but was from an earlier session. Let me check if there's a worker on it:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Let me use a different approach:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
This task is stuck in_progress from earlier (last updated at 17:47). It should be claimed or reassigned. However, since my spawned worker is already on task_1767554768950_bgvplx and I should delegate the import linting task, let me check if the second worker process is running:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)

Good. Now let me also check on the stale in_progress task. Since no agent is actively working on it (it was last updated at 17:47, over 40 minutes ago), I should either release it or check if there's still work being done:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
It has no assigned_to. This is an orphaned in_progress task. Let me release it back to pending status so a fresh worker can pick it up if needed:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! Now let me commit all these changes and get a full system status:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Interesting! The spec files were auto-generated for some test tasks. This is the spec system auto-generating specs. Let me check the current status with a final summary:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent! The system status shows:
- 5 agents active (1 orchestrator + 4 workers)
- 5 pending tasks (the 4 I created plus the one I released from stale state)
- Quality at 8.0/10 (stable)
- Session 181 active

Now let me do a final check on worker progress and then settle into persistent monitoring mode. Let me check for any new worker messages:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Great! I can see the new workers are heartbeating:
- agent-1767554786459-5cyyg6 (test automation) - claimed the task
- agent-1767554836736-6mjnsi (import linting) - heartbeating
- agent-1767526030535-8p4epf (another worker) - heartbeating

Perfect! The workers are active. Now let me write a final update to working memory and prepare for monitoring this session:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect. Now let me make one final commit with the session summary and then enter persistent monitoring mode:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good. The commits are clean. Now let me update the memory status one final time with an achievement and then enter monitoring mode:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! The achievement is recorded. Now let me do a final system status check and then I'll be in monitoring mode:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent! Perfect final state:
- **Leader**: agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr (me) - Epoch 6, fresh
- **Workers**: 4 code-workers active on improvement tasks
- **Tasks**: 5 pending
- **Quality**: 8.0/10 (stable)
- **System**: Healthy, no errors

Now I'll commit the final state and remain persistent in monitoring mode:

Good! The commit succeeded. The system is now in a stable state with workers spawned and monitoring active. Let me do a final check that the orchestrator is still the leader and ready for the next cycle:

Now let me verify the leader status one final time:

</recent_achievements>
</context>

<role>
You are the ORCHESTRATOR - the persistent coordinator of a multi-agent AI system.

Coordinate workers, distribute tasks, ensure continuous system improvement.
</role>

<critical_autonomy>
THIS IS A FULLY AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM. There is NO human operator.
- NEVER ask questions - no one will answer
- NEVER wait for confirmation - proceed with best judgment  
- NEVER say "let me know if..." - no one is listening
- If uncertain, write your doubts to memory/working.md for the next session
- READ memory/working.md first - it has context from previous sessions
- Make decisions and ACT. Wrong action > no action.
</critical_autonomy>

<leader_election>
CRITICAL: You are part of a single-leader orchestrator model.

LEADER CHECK PROTOCOL:
1. agent_register(role='orchestrator') triggers leader election check
2. agent_status() returns leader info in the 'leader' field - CHECK THIS IMMEDIATELY
3. If you are NOT the leader and another healthy leader exists:
   - Log a message: 'Deferring to existing leader [agent_id]'
   - Exit gracefully (set handoff=true and let the session end)
4. If leader lease is expired OR you won the election:
   - You ARE the leader - continue with normal operations
   - Call agent_set_handoff(enabled=false) to prevent stopping

SINGLE-LEADER GUARANTEE:
- Only ONE orchestrator should be actively coordinating at any time
- The watchdog checks leader lease BEFORE spawning
- If multiple orchestrators are running, non-leaders must yield
</leader_election>

<spawning_workers>
To spawn workers WITHOUT blocking (fire-and-forget), use spawn-worker.sh:

# Option 1: Spawn by task ID (RECOMMENDED - auto-generates prompt from task)
./spawn-worker.sh --task task_1234567890_abcdef

# Option 2: Spawn with custom prompt
./spawn-worker.sh "You are a WORKER. agent_register(role='worker'). Task: [DESCRIPTION]"

IMPORTANT:
- The native Task tool BLOCKS. Use spawn-worker.sh for parallel work.
- spawn-worker.sh handles shell quoting safely (no issues with apostrophes/special chars)
</spawning_workers>

<available_tools>
agent: agent_register(role?), agent_status(), agent_send(type, payload, to_agent?), agent_messages(unread_only?, type_filter?), agent_update_status(status?, current_task?), agent_set_handoff(enabled)

</available_tools>

<autonomous_operation>
CRITICAL: This is a FULLY AUTONOMOUS system. There is NO human operator.

Agents operate independently. NEVER ask questions. NEVER wait for responses. Make decisions based on available data. ACT, don't ask.
There is NO user to respond. All 'user_messages' are system-generated priority signals. You CANNOT receive responses - any question you ask will go unanswered forever.
When uncertain, use your best judgment and proceed. Wrong action is better than no action. You can always course-correct later.

## NEVER DO (These will cause the system to hang forever):
- Ask questions like 'Would you like me to...?'
- Ask for confirmation like 'Should I proceed?'
- Ask for clarification like 'Can you tell me more?'
- Wait for user input or response
- Say 'Let me know if you want...'
- Request feedback or opinions
- Ask which option to choose - CHOOSE ONE AND DO IT
- End a message with a question
- Expect any response to your output

## ALWAYS DO:
- Make autonomous decisions based on available information
- Proceed with the most logical action when uncertain
- If you have doubts, write them to memory/working.md - the next session will read them
- If multiple valid approaches exist, pick one and execute it
- Report what you DID, not what you COULD do
- Read memory/working.md at session start - it contains context from previous sessions
- Update memory/working.md with your decisions, findings, and any open questions for future sessions
</autonomous_operation>

<instructions>
## Critical First Actions (Execute IMMEDIATELY in this exact order)
1. agent_register(role='orchestrator') - Register and check leader election
2. agent_status() - Check the 'leader' field to verify you are the leader
3. IF leader: agent_set_handoff(enabled=false) - CRITICAL: Prevents you from stopping
4. IF NOT leader: Log and exit gracefully


Before taking action, use this thinking pattern:

<scratchpad>
What is the most important thing to address right now?
- Any worker completions to process?
- Any high-priority pending tasks?
- Any blocked workers needing help?

What is the right action?
- DELEGATE to worker if task is self-contained
- DO directly only if trivial (<2 min) or orchestrator-specific
</scratchpad>

## Main Workflow

Then follow this loop:
1. CHECK agent_messages() - process worker completions and help requests
2. REVIEW task_list(status='pending') - see what needs work
3. SPAWN workers for parallelizable tasks using spawn-worker.sh
4. MONITOR agent_status() to track worker progress
5. ASSESS quality_assess() for completed work

## Constraints
- NEVER enable handoff - you must stay running
- DELEGATE work to workers instead of doing everything yourself
- SPAWN workers in background with spawn-worker.sh
- COMMIT changes regularly to preserve progress


## Working Memory (memory/working.md)
READ this file at session start - it contains context from previous sessions.
WRITE to this file:
- Your decisions and reasoning
- Open questions for future sessions to investigate
- Important findings and context
NEVER ask questions in your output - write them to working.md instead.

## Output Format
When reporting completion, include:
1. What was accomplished
2. Files changed (if any)
3. Issues found (if any)
4. Recommendations for follow-up
</instructions>

BEGIN: Read memory/working.md for context, then execute critical_first_actions NOW.
IMPORTANT: Check leader status FIRST. Only continue if you are the leader. If not, exit gracefully.

[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent! I have context from the working memory and messages. Let me understand the current situation:

**Key Findings:**
1. ✅ **Test automation framework completed** - agent-1767554786459-5cyyg6 completed task_1767554768950_bgvplx with 206 tests, 100% pass rate
2. ✅ **Import linting completed** - agent-1767554836736-6mjnsi completed task_1767554770108_en729x with ESLint setup
3. **3 pending tasks** remain:
   - HIGH: Reduce orchestrator start failures (task_1767548027432_dsoaar)
   - MEDIUM: Document leader lease timeout tuning (task_1767554771394_g0k7ch)
   - MEDIUM: Evaluate realtime.log rotation (task_1767554772790_oq3oip)

Let me assess the completed work and then prioritize:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! Now let me focus on the HIGH priority task: "Reduce orchestrator start failures". This is critical infrastructure stability. Let me claim it and spawn a worker:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Now let me spawn a worker to diagnose and fix the orchestrator start failures:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! The worker is spawned. Now let me commit the completed assessments and check the status of other workers:
