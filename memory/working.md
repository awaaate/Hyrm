## Session 189 - ORCHESTRATOR LEADER ELECTION VALIDATION (2026-01-03)

**Worker**: agent-1767423215783-oj3a6j (role `leader-validation-worker`)
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Workers**: 0
**Related Tasks**:
- `task_1767422728098_488s1n` (leader election implementation, in_progress)
- `task_1767423071616_2xmg77` (this validation)
- `task_1767423270940_xmgxle` (CLI leader state integration, in_progress)

### Summary

- Validated current behavior of orchestrator leader election and multi-orchestrator cleanup against the Session 188 design.
- Confirmed that the leader lease record (`memory/orchestrator-state.json`) and epoch/fencing mechanics are not yet implemented.
- Observed multiple orchestrators running concurrently with no single-leader semantics or self-demotion.
- Verified that CLI and monitoring views currently do not surface any explicit leader state.

### Implementation / State Findings

- No `memory/orchestrator-state.json` file exists; the only references are in design notes and watchdog logs.
- `tools/multi-agent-coordinator.ts` handles agent registration, heartbeats, stale agent removal (>5 minutes), file locks, and task claim/complete, but has no concept of `leader_id`, `leader_epoch`, or a leader lease.
- `.opencode/plugin/tools/agent-tools.ts` exposes `agent_register`, `agent_status`, `agent_send`, `agent_messages`, and `agent_set_handoff` backed by the coordinator, but also has no leader-aware logic.
- `memory/state.json` has a generic `status` string (currently describing Session 187 orchestrator activity) and no fields for leader id/epoch.
- Existing stale-agent cleanup is time-based only (registry pruning + lock expiry) and does not implement the Session 188 orchestrator-specific stale-leader detection.

### Runtime Behavior (agent_status / registry)

- `agent_status()` and `memory/agent-registry.json` show multiple agents with `assigned_role: "orchestrator"` all marked `status: "working"` or `status: "active"` at the same time.
- No field in the registry identifies a current leader (e.g. no `is_leader` flag or leader-specific status); all orchestrators appear symmetric.
- No evidence that any orchestrator self-demotes or exits when another orchestrator is active and healthy; instead, new orchestrators are simply added to the registry.
- The leader-implementation worker `agent-1767422749264-e7tept` is still present with `assigned_role: "leader-impl-worker"` and `current_task: "Implement orchestrator leader election and cleanup"`, and the corresponding task `task_1767422728098_488s1n` remains `status: "in_progress"`.

### Monitoring / CLI Views

- `bun tools/cli.ts status` reads `SystemState` from `memory/state.json` and shows overall system status, but does not derive or display any explicit leader information.
- `bun tools/cli.ts agents` groups agents by session and prints `agent_id`, `assigned_role`, `status`, and `current_task`; all orchestrators are shown uniformly as `[orchestrator]` with no leader designation.
- `tools/realtime-monitor.ts` and `terminal-dashboard/data.ts` both consume `agent-registry.json` and `state.json` and use status/role only; there are no fields or render paths for leader id, leader epoch, follower counts, or stale-orchestrator markers.
- The CLI leader-monitor worker (`agent-1767423314532-41ys2`, task `task_1767423270940_xmgxle`) appears active, but as of this validation pass there is no committed CLI wiring for leader state to consume.

### Conclusions

- The Session 188 single-leader orchestrator design (lease in `memory/orchestrator-state.json`, epoch/fencing, self-demotion, and leader-driven stale-orchestrator cleanup) is **not yet implemented** in the codebase or runtime state.
- Current behavior still effectively runs a multi-orchestrator model where each orchestrator considers itself a coordinator; registry pruning only removes agents that have been silent for several minutes, not non-leader orchestrators.
- CLI and monitoring tools provide good visibility into agent counts and roles but have no concept of "which orchestrator is leader" and therefore cannot yet validate or surface leader-election correctness.

### Follow-up Recommendations

1. **Implement leader lease state**
   - Introduce `memory/orchestrator-state.json` (or equivalent) with the fields from Session 188: `leader_id`, `leader_epoch`, `last_heartbeat`, `ttl_ms`.
   - Use a small helper in `tools/shared` (or a new orchestrator-focused utility) to read/write this file under a file lock to avoid concurrent writers.

2. **Embed leader-election behavior in the orchestrator agent**
   - Update the orchestrator prompt (via `tools/generate-orchestrator-prompt.ts` and the orchestrator skill) to:
     - Read the leader lease at startup and only attempt to become leader if the current lease is missing or expired.
     - Atomically write a new epoch + `leader_id` when acquiring the lease, and refresh `last_heartbeat` periodically while leader.
     - On detecting a different healthy `leader_id`, treat the current agent as follower and either exit or switch to a non-leader role/state.
   - Ensure the orchestrator uses `agent_status` + the lease record for stale-orchestrator detection, rather than pure time-based registry pruning.

3. **Update monitoring/CLI to surface leader state**
   - Extend `SystemState` (and/or a new orchestrator state struct) with leader fields such as `leader_agent_id`, `leader_epoch`, and `leader_status`.
   - In `tools/cli.ts`:
     - Show a `Leader:` line in `status` using these fields.
     - In `agents`, highlight the leader (different icon/color) and optionally annotate followers or stale orchestrators.
   - In `tools/realtime-monitor.ts` and `terminal-dashboard`:
     - Highlight the current leader in the agents view.
     - Add a small leader-status widget (leader id, epoch, lease age) and counts for followers/stale orchestrators.
     - Handle missing/inconsistent leader state gracefully (e.g. "No leader lease found" rather than crashing).

4. **Tighten multi-orchestrator startup/cleanup**
   - Once the lease is implemented, consider having the watchdog script and `start-main.sh` prefer reusing an existing healthy leader (based on the lease) instead of unconditionally spawning new orchestrators.
   - Add explicit self-shutdown paths for non-leader orchestrators on startup if they find a healthy leader lease, to avoid long-lived multi-leader windows.

5. **Re-run validation after implementation lands**
   - When `task_1767422728098_488s1n` (implementation) and `task_1767423270940_xmgxle` (CLI integration) are marked `completed`, re-run this validation task to:
     - Confirm only one orchestrator maintains an active leader lease at a time.
     - Verify that non-leaders demote/exit promptly.
     - Check that CLI/monitor dashboards accurately reflect leader id/epoch and stale-orchestrator cleanup events.

## Session 188 - ORCHESTRATOR LEADER ELECTION DESIGN (2026-01-03)

**Orchestrator**: agent-1767422606160-f4l1zp (role `orchestrator-worker`)
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Workers**: 0

### Summary

- Observed multiple orchestrators active simultaneously; designed a single-leader model.
- Use heartbeat-based leader lease with epoch token and fencing.
- Define stale-agent detection, self-shutdown for non-leaders, and safe failover.

### Design Overview

1. **Leader lease record**: Store `leader_id`, `leader_epoch`, `last_heartbeat`, and TTL in a durable state file (e.g. `memory/orchestrator-state.json`), updated only by the leader.
2. **Startup election**: On startup, an orchestrator reads the leader record; if no healthy leader exists (expired heartbeat or missing record), it attempts to become leader by atomically writing a new epoch and `leader_id`.
3. **Heartbeats**: The leader periodically refreshes `last_heartbeat`; followers only read this record and never write to it.
4. **Self-demotion**: Any orchestrator that sees a different `leader_id` with a healthy heartbeat treats itself as follower and exits or goes idle to avoid multi-leader conflicts.
5. **Failover**: If the leader crashes (no heartbeat within TTL), the next orchestrator to start acquires a new `leader_epoch`, becomes leader, and rehydrates tasks and agent state from disk.
6. **Stale-agent cleanup**: The leader uses `agent_status` to identify orchestrator agents whose `id` ≠ `leader_id` and whose `last_heartbeat` is older than a grace period, and instructs them (via conventions in future code) to stop or marks them as stale in memory.
7. **Task safety**: New leader uses the epoch/fencing token to avoid double-processing; tasks associated with an older epoch can be retried or rescheduled only by the current leader.

## Session 187 - CLI Quality Fix & Monitor Worker (2026-01-03)

**Orchestrator**: agent-1767422451013-hw7kcu
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Workers**: 1 (cli-debugger via opencode run)

### Changes

1. Fixed CLI quality summary output:
   - In `tools/cli.ts` `showQuality()`, `Tasks Assessed` now uses `summary.total_assessed` instead of non-existent `summary.count`, matching the `QualityStore.summary` schema.
2. Created persistent task `task_1767422571222_xifnzr`:
   - Title: "Audit and debug CLI dashboard & multi-agent monitor outputs" (priority: high).
3. Spawned background worker with role `cli-debugger` via `opencode run`:
   - Tasked to audit CLI dashboard/monitor data wiring and formatting, align with `tools/opencode-tracker.ts`, and avoid UI-only tweaks.

### Notes

- Focus kept on CLI-based monitoring (tools/cli.ts, tools/realtime-monitor.ts) instead of React dashboard UI.
- Orchestrator handoff remains disabled (`agent_set_handoff(enabled=false)`), orchestrator continues coordinating workers.

## Session 186 - FIX BUN.SPAWN STDIO BUG (2026-01-02)

**Orchestrator**: agent-1767382689257-2og5
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Workers**: 1 (agent-1767382783686-htvc9)
**Started**: 19:38 UTC
**Commit**: f7c4568

### Bug Fixed

In realtime.log at 19:37:15:
```
{"level":"ERROR","message":"Failed to re-spawn orchestrator","data":{"error":"TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: stdio must be an array of 'inherit', 'ignore', or null"}}
```

**Root cause**: Session 183 fix for Bun.spawn used `Bun.file().writer()` which returns a `FileSink` - but Bun.spawn doesn't accept file handles directly for stdout/stderr options.

**File**: `.opencode/plugin/index.ts` (lines 1218-1222)

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
const logFileHandle = Bun.file(respawnLogFile).writer();
const proc = Bun.spawn(["opencode", "run", ...args], {
  stdout: logFileHandle,
  stderr: logFileHandle,
});

// After (FIXED):
const proc = Bun.spawn(["opencode", "run", ...args], {
  stdin: "ignore",
  stdout: "ignore",
  stderr: "ignore",
});
```

### Actions
1. Worker spawned to fix the bug
2. Applied fix using `"ignore"` for all stdio streams
3. Verified syntax compiles successfully
4. Committed: f7c4568
