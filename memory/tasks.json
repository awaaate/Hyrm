Modify isPrimaryInstance() to write INSTANCE_ID to lock file immediately\n2. Add a short delay (50-100ms) before checking if this instance is primary\n3. The instance with the smallest INSTANCE_ID among those written wins\n4. Verify by running a tool call and checking realtime.log shows only 1 entry",
