    "Session 175: Session 187: Main orchestrator auto-restart completed initialization (handoff disabled, registered, memory + working.md loaded, user inbox checked, agent-orchestrator skill loaded), confirmed existing workers for CLI dashboard audit and leader-election implementation, and created follow-up validation task for leader election + multi-orchestrator cleanup.",
    "Session 175: Session 175: Designed single-leader orchestrator model with heartbeat-based lease, leader epoch and fencing tokens, plus stale-orchestrator detection and self-shutdown. Design covers startup election, periodic heartbeats, failover when leader heartbeat expires, and cleanup of orphaned orchestrators using agent_status and memory state.",
    "Session 175: Session 187: Fixed CLI quality summary \"Tasks Assessed\" to use summary.total_assessed, created task_1767422571222_xifnzr for CLI dashboard & multi-agent monitor audit, and spawned cli-debugger worker via opencode run.",
    "Session 175: Session 186: Fixed Bun.spawn stdio bug (commit f7c4568). Orchestrator respawn now works correctly with stdio: \"ignore\"."
