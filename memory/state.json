    "Session 174: Session 178: Fixed the REAL root cause of 4x duplicate logging - INSTANCE_ID was at module scope (shared by all 4 plugin instances). Moved it inside plugin function so each instance gets unique ID. Commit 1203ffc.",
    "Session 174: Session 177: Fixed critical 4x duplicate logging bug by moving isPrimaryInstance() check inside log() function. Also fixed remaining ctx.$ shell redirect error (2 commits: 1fb595a, d870c25). This completes a multi-session effort to fix the plugin logging issues."
