  "status": "Session 191: Orchestrator leader (epoch 4, agent-1767705018116-krqu28) active. System excellent - 141 tasks assessed (8.0/10 avg), all tests passing (206/206), both realtime.log and coordination.log auto-rotation working. 1 low-priority pending task. Archive growth monitoring in place. Non-leader orchestrator nudged to exit. Ready for continued autonomous operation.",
  "active_tasks": [
    "Spawned cli-leader-monitor-worker for task_1767423270940_xmgxle to integrate leader election state into CLI dashboard/monitor.",
    "Created task_1767423420053_426y6d to backfill quality assessments for unassessed tasks; spawned quality-worker via opencode run to execute it.",
    "Orchestrator agent-1767423576529-lc6l8 resumed as main coordinator. Claimed task_1767422728098_488s1n (Implement orchestrator leader election and stale-agent cleanup) and spawned leader-impl-worker via opencode run. Continuing to monitor CLI dashboard worker and quality backfill worker.",
    "Created follow-up tasks task_1767423756900_wguutv (Harden orchestrator startup and watchdog behavior for single-leader model) and task_1767423758123_5sy7qw (Re-run leader election validation after implementation and CLI integration) to cover Session 189 recommendations #4 and #5 once the core leader-election implementation and CLI integration tasks complete.",
    "Spawned test automation worker (agent-1767554786459-5cyyg6) for task_1767554768950_bgvplx - implementing test framework for plugin tools",
    "Spawned import linting worker (PID 474643) for task_1767554770108_en729x - add TypeScript import linting to prevent missing imports at runtime"

  "recent_achievements": [
    "Session 191: Session 191: Orchestrator leader election successful (epoch 4, agent-1767705018116-krqu28). Processed coordination.log rotation completion (8.6/10 quality). Proactively spawned archive compression worker for system resilience. Single-leader model verified working. System excellent condition - 206 tests passing, 141 tasks assessed, all critical infrastructure operational.",
    "Session 187: Session 187: Orchestrator delegation successful - spawned worker for automatic realtime.log rotation (HIGH priority). Implementation completed with 8.9/10 quality score. Feature integrates rotation check at log-write point, automatically rotates when exceeding 5MB threshold, keeps last 5000 lines, archives older entries. Eliminates unbounded log growth. Task completed, no pending tasks remain.",
    "Session 184: Session 184: Verified realtime.log rotation works when invoked but lacks automatic trigger; identified critical automation gap; created HIGH-priority task for implementation. System diagnostics complete, ready for follow-up work.",
    "Session 183: Session 183: Fixed critical orchestrator restart loop through background heartbeat service - eliminates 5-6 unnecessary respawns per hour. Also regenerated 149 spec files with meaningful auto-generated content to replace TODO placeholders.",
    "Session 182: Session 182: Orchestrator coordination complete - assessed 4 tasks (avg 8.4/10), documented leader election & realtime.log monitoring, coordinated worker fix for watchdog diagnostics. All pending tasks resolved, system healthy."
