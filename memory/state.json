    "Session 175: Session 175 / current orchestrator (agent-1767423494522-3a1e0r): Requeued critical task task_1767422728098_488s1n (Implement orchestrator leader election and stale-agent cleanup) after detecting stale leader-impl-worker, and spawned a fresh leader-impl-worker via opencode run to implement the Session 188 single-leader design.",
    "Session 175: Session 187: Main orchestrator auto-restart completed initialization (handoff disabled, registered, memory + working.md loaded, user inbox checked, agent-orchestrator skill loaded), confirmed existing workers for CLI dashboard audit and leader-election implementation, and created follow-up validation task for leader election + multi-orchestrator cleanup.",
    "Session 175: Session 175: Designed single-leader orchestrator model with heartbeat-based lease, leader epoch and fencing tokens, plus stale-orchestrator detection and self-shutdown. Design covers startup election, periodic heartbeats, failover when leader heartbeat expires, and cleanup of orphaned orchestrators using agent_status and memory state."
