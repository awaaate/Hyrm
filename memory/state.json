  "status": "Session 206: Orchestrator leader (epoch 19) confirmed. CRITICAL heartbeat script syntax errors identified - causing leader lease expiry at 240-250s. Root cause: lines 325,335,337 use `local` outside function. Spawned critical worker (PID 223906) to fix. System stable, 0 pending user tasks, 1 critical infrastructure fix in progress.",
  "active_tasks": [
    "Spawned cli-leader-monitor-worker for task_1767423270940_xmgxle to integrate leader election state into CLI dashboard/monitor.",
    "Created task_1767423420053_426y6d to backfill quality assessments for unassessed tasks; spawned quality-worker via opencode run to execute it.",
    "Orchestrator agent-1767423576529-lc6l8 resumed as main coordinator. Claimed task_1767422728098_488s1n (Implement orchestrator leader election and stale-agent cleanup) and spawned leader-impl-worker via opencode run. Continuing to monitor CLI dashboard worker and quality backfill worker.",
    "Created follow-up tasks task_1767423756900_wguutv (Harden orchestrator startup and watchdog behavior for single-leader model) and task_1767423758123_5sy7qw (Re-run leader election validation after implementation and CLI integration) to cover Session 189 recommendations #4 and #5 once the core leader-election implementation and CLI integration tasks complete.",
    "Spawned test automation worker (agent-1767554786459-5cyyg6) for task_1767554768950_bgvplx - implementing test framework for plugin tools",
    "Spawned import linting worker (PID 474643) for task_1767554770108_en729x - add TypeScript import linting to prevent missing imports at runtime",
    "Session 192: Spawned 2 workers for high-impact improvements - orphaned task detection (PID 33224) and dashboard leader visibility (PID 33681)"

  "recent_achievements": [
    "Session 205: Session 205: Performance metrics widget completed (9/10 quality). Real-time slowest operations, success rates, throughput metrics integrated into CLI dashboard. System now has complete observability stack. 152 tasks completed, 1 LOW-priority task pending (predictive alerting). Single-leader model (epoch 18) stable and healthy.",
    "Session 200: Session 200: Orchestrator assessed Session 199 follow-up tasks - heartbeat service consolidation (8.6/10) and crash log cleanup (9.5/10). Root cause of orchestrator restarts (heartbeat decay) fixed in Session 198. System stability improved from ~2 restarts/hour to target <1/hour. Verified single-leader election model working correctly with epoch 13 leader.",
    "Session 191: Session 191: Orchestrator leader election successful (epoch 4, agent-1767705018116-krqu28). Processed coordination.log rotation completion (8.6/10 quality). Proactively spawned archive compression worker for system resilience. Single-leader model verified working. System excellent condition - 206 tests passing, 141 tasks assessed, all critical infrastructure operational.",
    "Session 187: Session 187: Orchestrator delegation successful - spawned worker for automatic realtime.log rotation (HIGH priority). Implementation completed with 8.9/10 quality score. Feature integrates rotation check at log-write point, automatically rotates when exceeding 5MB threshold, keeps last 5000 lines, archives older entries. Eliminates unbounded log growth. Task completed, no pending tasks remain.",
    "Session 184: Session 184: Verified realtime.log rotation works when invoked but lacks automatic trigger; identified critical automation gap; created HIGH-priority task for implementation. System diagnostics complete, ready for follow-up work."
