Key deliverables: 1) Create tools/shared/error-handler.ts with typed error classes 2) Implement readJsonSafe() with backup restoration on parse failure 3) Replace empty catch blocks with structured logging 4) Add JSON schema validation for critical state files (state.json, tasks.json, agent-registry.json). Motivation: 88 instances of empty catch blocks currently silently swallow errors, and corrupted JSON causes failures with no recovery path."},"read_by":[]}

Currently only orchestrator-state.json has locking. Key deliverables: 1) Create atomic file operations wrapper using .lock files 2) Implement optimistic locking pattern for tasks.json and state.json 3) Add retry logic with exponential backoff for lock contention 4) Audit and protect all shared file writes. Motivation: Multiple agents can corrupt data when writing simultaneously to tasks.json, state.json, etc."},"read_by":[]}
