Log currently 5.4MB with 28k+ lines. Without automatic rotation, log grows unbounded. Integrate rotation into: (1) Orchestrator idle-cleanup task loop, or (2) Plugin log append (check size before write), or (3) Session-end hooks. Add monitoring to alert if realtime.log exceeds 5MB (indicates rotation isn't running).\",","priority":"high","tags":["logging","system-health","automation"]}
