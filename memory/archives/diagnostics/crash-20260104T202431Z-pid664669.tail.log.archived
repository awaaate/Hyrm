Now let me monitor agent status and check on the worker I spawned:
[MultiAgent] 2026-01-04T20:21:39.960Z [INFO] [agent-1767558030320-oph5p] File locked: /app/workspace/memory/orchestrator-state.json

[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good - I have 4 agents now (2 orchestrators + 2 code-workers). I'm still the leader. Let me check for messages from workers and continue monitoring:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
All messages marked as read. The CI worker has been spawned. Let me continue monitoring and update memory status:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! The GitHub Actions workflows were created automatically when the CI task was created. Let me verify they're properly set up:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent! The GitHub Actions workflow is properly configured. Now let me continue monitoring the system and check if there are any other critical areas. Let me do a final system health check:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent status! All tests passing, coordination log is growing but manageable. Now let me monitor agent progress and prepare for potential worker completions. Let me also spawn a second worker for the next highest priority task while the first one is running:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! Now I have two workers running in parallel. Let me continue my monitoring cycle by checking on messages periodically and looking for any issues:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
8 worker processes active - good parallelization. Let me now prepare the system for long-term stability by creating a monitoring checkpoint and ensuring critical functions work:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! Leader state is properly maintained. Now let me set up a long-term monitoring pattern. Let me update memory with recommendations for the next session and commit:

[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! CI task completed with 8.5/10 quality score. Now let me check on the crash investigation worker:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Worker may have finished. Let me check for its completion message:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Just heartbeats - crash investigation is still running. Let me continue monitoring and commit my CI task completion:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent! Now let me continue monitoring. Let me check the system status and see if we need to take any immediate actions:

Good! I still have 5 active agents (2 orchestrators + 3 code-workers). 5 pending tasks remain. The crash investigation task should complete soon. Let me monitor progress and continue the autonomous improvement cycle. Let me now spawn another worker for the documentation task while the crash investigation completes:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! Now I have 3 workers running in parallel. Let me continue the monitoring pattern and set up a checkpoint. Let me also check the current git status:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! 7 worker processes running in parallel. The system is well-distributed. Let me now continue monitoring for worker completions and check the memory status periodically. Let me create a comprehensive summary and keep the system stable:

Now let me monitor the realtime.log and system stability. Since I'm operating as the persistent orchestrator, let me verify my heartbeat is being maintained:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! My heartbeat is being refreshed regularly (every ~60 seconds as expected) and all tests continue to pass. The system is operating smoothly. Let me now do a final comprehensive check and ensure everything is stable for continued operation:

Perfect! Now let me verify the system is running stably and can continue. Let me check one more time for any urgent messages or worker completions:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
All heartbeats - workers still processing. Good! The system is running smoothly with no blockers. Let me maintain my leadership and continue monitoring. Let me check the status one more time to ensure everything is healthy for long-term operation:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! The memory system is tracking properly. I'm operating as the persistent orchestrator in a stable state. The system is ready for long-term continued operation. Let me document my final status and then keep monitoring:
