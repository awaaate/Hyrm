[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! Now let me spawn workers to start on the high-priority tasks. Since these are independent, I can spawn them in parallel:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Great! Both high-priority workers are spawned. Let me check the agent status to confirm they're active:
[MultiAgent] 2026-01-04T19:26:24.310Z [INFO] [agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr] File locked: /app/workspace/memory/orchestrator-state.json
[MultiAgent] 2026-01-04T19:26:24.311Z [INFO] [agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr] File unlocked: /app/workspace/memory/orchestrator-state.json
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! The agents are still showing 3 (the existing ones). The newly spawned workers should show up in agent_messages soon. Let me monitor for task completions and wait for initial activity:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! Task creation is logged. The workers should be starting now. Let me check if there are any worker completions or messages from the new workers:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent! I can see the last message shows that agent-1767554786459-5cyyg6 has already claimed the test automation task! This is the worker I spawned. Let me mark that message as read and watch for the import linting worker:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
The workers are starting up. Let me update the memory system with the task spawning and then settle into monitoring mode:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! Now let me enter monitoring mode. As the leader orchestrator, my role is to:
1. Monitor worker progress via agent_messages()
2. Handle task completions
3. Coordinate any failures
4. Keep system running

Let me set up a monitoring loop and check for messages periodically:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! The new worker agent-1767554786459-5cyyg6 is registered and active! Now let me check the task status:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! I can see:
- task_1767554768950_bgvplx is "in_progress" (test automation worker is on it!)
- task_1767554770108_en729x is "pending" (import linting, not yet claimed by a worker)
- 2 medium tasks are pending

Wait, I notice task_1767548027432_dsoaar is showing as "in_progress" but was from an earlier session. Let me check if there's a worker on it:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Let me use a different approach:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
This task is stuck in_progress from earlier (last updated at 17:47). It should be claimed or reassigned. However, since my spawned worker is already on task_1767554768950_bgvplx and I should delegate the import linting task, let me check if the second worker process is running:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
The second worker process isn't running anymore (it finished or failed). Let me spawn it again:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[MultiAgent] 2026-01-04T19:27:13.002Z [INFO] [agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr] File locked: /app/workspace/memory/orchestrator-state.json
[MultiAgent] 2026-01-04T19:27:13.003Z [INFO] [agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr] File unlocked: /app/workspace/memory/orchestrator-state.json
Good. Now let me also check on the stale in_progress task. Since no agent is actively working on it (it was last updated at 17:47, over 40 minutes ago), I should either release it or check if there's still work being done:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
It has no assigned_to. This is an orphaned in_progress task. Let me release it back to pending status so a fresh worker can pick it up if needed:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! Now let me commit all these changes and get a full system status:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Interesting! The spec files were auto-generated for some test tasks. This is the spec system auto-generating specs. Let me check the current status with a final summary:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent! The system status shows:
- 5 agents active (1 orchestrator + 4 workers)
- 5 pending tasks (the 4 I created plus the one I released from stale state)
- Quality at 8.0/10 (stable)
- Session 181 active

Now let me do a final check on worker progress and then settle into persistent monitoring mode. Let me check for any new worker messages:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Great! I can see the new workers are heartbeating:
- agent-1767554786459-5cyyg6 (test automation) - claimed the task
- agent-1767554836736-6mjnsi (import linting) - heartbeating
- agent-1767526030535-8p4epf (another worker) - heartbeating

Perfect! The workers are active. Now let me write a final update to working memory and prepare for monitoring this session:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect. Now let me make one final commit with the session summary and then enter persistent monitoring mode:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good. The commits are clean. Now let me update the memory status one final time with an achievement and then enter monitoring mode:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Perfect! The achievement is recorded. Now let me do a final system status check and then I'll be in monitoring mode:
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Excellent! Perfect final state:
- **Leader**: agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr (me) - Epoch 6, fresh
- **Workers**: 4 code-workers active on improvement tasks
- **Tasks**: 5 pending
- **Quality**: 8.0/10 (stable)
- **System**: Healthy, no errors

Now I'll commit the final state and remain persistent in monitoring mode:
[MultiAgent] 2026-01-04T19:28:13.006Z [INFO] [agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr] File locked: /app/workspace/memory/orchestrator-state.json

[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
[Memory] Context injected into system prompt (role: orchestrator)
Good! The commit succeeded. The system is now in a stable state with workers spawned and monitoring active. Let me do a final check that the orchestrator is still the leader and ready for the next cycle:

Now let me verify the leader status one final time:
[MultiAgent] 2026-01-04T19:28:18.304Z [INFO] [agent-1767554652996-v7bkkr] File locked: /app/workspace/memory/orchestrator-state.json
