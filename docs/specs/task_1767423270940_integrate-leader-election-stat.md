## Problem Statement

Update CLI monitoring tools (tools/cli.ts monitor/watch, tools/realtime-monitor.ts, and any supporting trackers) to surface the new single-leader orchestrator state. Show which orchestrator is leader, follower counts, and stale-orchestrator detections based on the leader-election implementation from task_1767422728098_488s1n and the design in Session 188 (memory/working.md). Focus on data correctness and robust error handling if leader state is missing or inconsistent; avoid cosmetic-only UI tweaks.
