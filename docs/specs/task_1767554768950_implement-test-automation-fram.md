## Problem Statement

Replace ad-hoc POC test tasks (v1/v2/v3/v4 pattern) with proper integration test framework. Should cover: agent registration, task creation/completion, quality assessment, memory operations. Use jest or vitest with proper setup/teardown.

**Additional Context**:
- [2026-01-04T19:26:10.926Z] Created GitHub issue #4
- [2026-01-04T19:29:42.446Z] Completed all requirements: replaced POC tests with professional framework, 206 tests passing, comprehensive documentation, npm scripts added. Commits: 76fa8d5, a470104"
- [2026-01-04T19:32:34.754Z] Test automation framework successfully replaced POC pattern with 206 comprehensive tests (100% pass). Unified test runner, npm scripts, and documentation complete. Framework ready for CI/CD integration.

## Goals

- Complete high-priority work to unblock downstream tasks
- Design and implement solution with appropriate abstraction
- Verify changes with tests and ensure no regressions

---

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Analysis**
