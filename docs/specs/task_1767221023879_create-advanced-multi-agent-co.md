## Problem Statement

Document and implement patterns for: parallel task execution, task dependencies, worker pools, load balancing between agents

**Additional Context**:
- [2025-12-31T22:47:47.529Z] Implemented: 1) Task dependencies with depends_on field, 2) Automatic unblocking when deps complete, 3) Worker pool patterns documented, 4) Load balancing patterns documented

## Goals

- Complete high-priority work to unblock downstream tasks
- Verify changes with tests and ensure no regressions

**Phase 2: Implementation**
  - Implement primary changes
  - Write tests for new functionality
  - Handle edge cases and error scenarios

**Phase 3: Integration & Validation**
  - Integrate with existing systems
  - Run full test suite
  - Code review and address feedback

**Phase 4: Verification & Documentation**
  - Verify changes in target environment
  - Update documentation and comments
  - Create PR/commit with clear messages
