## Problem Statement

User request: Better track conversations from .opencode storage. The opencode-tracker.ts has logic to read OpenCode's native session/message/part storage but needs better integration with our memory system. Tasks: 1) Enhance sync command to save richer data, 2) Auto-run sync on session start, 3) Extract key learnings from conversations, 4) Possibly consolidate with conversation-tracker.ts
