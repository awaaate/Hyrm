## Problem Statement

Create proper debugging infrastructure: save terminal outputs, create documentation agent for README generation.

**Additional Context**:
- [2026-01-02T12:20:53.949Z] Created debug-capture.ts tool with: run (capture command output), log (debug messages), list (view captures), view (inspect specific capture), clean (remove old captures). Added LOGS_DIR and appendLine to shared utilities.

## Goals

- Implement medium-priority feature to improve system
- Design and implement solution with appropriate abstraction
- Verify changes with tests and ensure no regressions

---

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Analysis**
  - Review task requirements and acceptance criteria
  - Identify dependencies and related systems
  - Plan approach and document assumptions

**Phase 2: Implementation**
  - Implement primary changes
  - Write tests for new functionality
  - Handle edge cases and error scenarios

**Phase 3: Integration & Validation**
  - Integrate with existing systems
  - Run full test suite
  - Code review and address feedback

**Phase 4: Verification & Documentation**
  - Verify changes in target environment
  - Update documentation and comments
  - Create PR/commit with clear messages

---

## Success Criteria

[ ] Code changes are clean, well-commented, and follow style guide
[ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e if applicable)
[ ] No regressions in existing functionality

---

## Notes

- Update this spec as requirements become clearer
- Reference task ID in commits: task_1767355254784_i5mmcr
- Keep implementation phases realistic and reviewable
