## Problem Statement

Create performance profiling that tracks: 1) Tool execution times 2) Context usage efficiency 3) Task completion rates by agent 4) Common error patterns. Generate automated suggestions for improvement based on historical data.

**Additional Context**:
- [2026-01-02T07:29:48.132Z] Created tools/agent-performance-profiler.ts with 8 commands: profile, tools, agents, efficiency, errors, suggestions, export, help. Features: tool execution time tracking, context usage efficiency analysis, task completion rates by agent, error pattern detection, automated optimization suggestions. Integrated with opencode-cli.ts via 'perf' and 'profile' commands.

## Goals

- Address technical debt or minor improvement
- Design comprehensive solution with proper error handling and documentation
- Verify changes with tests and ensure no regressions

---

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Analysis**
  - Review task requirements and acceptance criteria
  - Identify dependencies and related systems
  - Plan approach and document assumptions

**Phase 2: Design & Specification**
  - Create detailed design document or architecture notes
  - Validate approach with team/orchestrator
  - Prepare for incremental implementation

**Phase 3: Implementation**
  - Implement primary changes
  - Write tests for new functionality
  - Handle edge cases and error scenarios

**Phase 4: Integration & Validation**
  - Integrate with existing systems
  - Run full test suite
  - Code review and address feedback

**Phase 5: Verification & Documentation**
  - Verify changes in target environment
  - Update documentation and comments
  - Create PR/commit with clear messages

## Success Criteria

[ ] Code changes are clean, well-commented, and follow style guide
[ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e if applicable)
[ ] No regressions in existing functionality
[ ] Design reviewed and approved
[ ] Performance benchmarked if applicable
[ ] Error handling and logging comprehensive
