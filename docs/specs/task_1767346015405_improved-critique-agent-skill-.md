## Problem Statement

Updated the critique-agent skill file to include clear instructions on HOW TO SPAWN a critique agent using the Task tool. The critique-agent.ts CLI tool remains as a utility, but now the skill explains the proper way to spawn critique agents as real agents in the multi-agent system. Successfully demonstrated by spawning a critique agent that reviewed dashboard-ui/src/App.tsx and scored it 5.2/10.
