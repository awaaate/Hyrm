## Problem Statement

memory/realtime.log shows repeated plugin errors: ‘expected a command or assignment but got: "Redirect"’. Identify which tool/event emits this unexpected token, add input validation/sanitization, and ensure plugin errors are surfaced with actionable context (tool name + payload).

Success criteria:
- Error no longer appears in realtime.log during normal use
- When unexpected input occurs, logs include source tool/hook and offending payload
