## Problem Statement

The OpenCode session panel in the dashboard should show the messages for each session selected. User wants to see actual conversation messages when clicking on a session in the dashboard UI.

- [2026-01-02T13:06:44.099Z] Implemented OpenCode sessions panel with message viewing. Added API endpoints in server.ts, created OpenCodeSessionsPanel component, and added OpenCode tab to dashboard.
- [2026-01-02T13:07:03.937Z] Completed by agent-1767358953150-y6s0s9. Implemented OpenCode sessions panel with message viewing. Added API endpoints, OpenCodeSessionsPanel component, types. Quality: 8.2/10.
