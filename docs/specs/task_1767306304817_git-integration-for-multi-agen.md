## Problem Statement

Integrate git into the multi-agent system to enable: 1) Automatic commit tracking for code changes made by agents 2) Git status in dashboard showing repo state 3) Branch management for parallel agent work 4) Commit history in working memory 5) Git hooks integration for quality checks 6) Auto-commit for completed tasks with quality metadata. This allows agents to have version control awareness and enables rollback of agent changes if needed.
