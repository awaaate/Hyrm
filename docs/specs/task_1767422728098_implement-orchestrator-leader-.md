## Problem Statement

Implement the single-leader orchestrator model with heartbeat-based lease, leader epoch and fencing tokens, stale-orchestrator detection, and self-shutdown, based on the design from task_1767422564433_bk0h88. Integrate with agent_status, agent_set_handoff, and existing monitoring so that only one orchestrator acts as leader at a time while others stay idle or shut down safely.
