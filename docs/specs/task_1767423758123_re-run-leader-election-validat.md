## Problem Statement

Once the single-leader orchestrator model is implemented (task_1767422728098_488s1n) and leader state is surfaced in CLI/monitoring (task_1767423270940_xmgxle), perform a second end-to-end validation of leader election and stale-orchestrator cleanup as described in Session 189. Confirm only one orchestrator holds the leader lease at a time, non-leaders self-demote or exit, and CLI/monitoring views accurately reflect leader id/epoch and cleanup events. Document findings in memory/working.md and update task quality assessments if needed.
