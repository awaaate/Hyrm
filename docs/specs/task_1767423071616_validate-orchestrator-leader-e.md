## Problem Statement

After task_1767422728098_488s1n implements the single-leader orchestrator model with heartbeat-based lease, leader epoch and fencing tokens, and stale-orchestrator cleanup, validate the behavior in a live multi-agent run. Ensure only one orchestrator acts as leader, others demote or exit safely, and monitoring/CLI views reflect correct leader state. Propose any follow-up refinements needed.
