## Problem Statement

Analyze the current multi-orchestrator state (multiple active orchestrators in agent_status) and propose a design for a single-leader orchestrator with safe failover and stale-agent cleanup. Focus on architecture and coordination patterns; avoid code changes for now. Document findings in working memory (memory/working.md or a design note) and report completion via agent_send(task_complete).
