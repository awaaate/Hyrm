## Problem Statement

Review skills from https://github.com/anthropics/skills and consider adapting them for our OpenCode multi-agent system. Focus on development/technical skills.

**Additional Context**:
- [2025-12-31T22:41:00.600Z] Explored Anthropic Agent Skills at https://github.com/anthropics/skills and https://agentskills.io. Our system already uses Agent Skills format in .opencode/skill/ with three skills: agent-orchestrator, memory-manager, multi-agent-patterns. The format matches the spec with SKILL.md files containing YAML frontmatter (name, description) and markdown instructions.

## Goals

- Implement medium-priority feature to improve system
- Verify changes with tests and ensure no regressions

---

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Analysis**
  - Review task requirements and acceptance criteria
  - Identify dependencies and related systems
  - Plan approach and document assumptions

**Phase 2: Implementation**
  - Implement primary changes
  - Write tests for new functionality
  - Handle edge cases and error scenarios

**Phase 3: Integration & Validation**
  - Integrate with existing systems
  - Run full test suite
  - Code review and address feedback

**Phase 4: Verification & Documentation**
  - Verify changes in target environment
  - Update documentation and comments
  - Create PR/commit with clear messages
