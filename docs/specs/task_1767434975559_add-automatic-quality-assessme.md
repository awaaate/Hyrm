## Problem Statement

Implement automatic quality assessment when tasks are marked completed. Currently quality assessment is fully manual, leading to incomplete metrics. Key deliverables: 1) Add auto_assess option to task_update when completing 2) Create heuristic scoring based on task metadata (duration, complexity, notes) 3) Mark auto-assessments with flag to distinguish from manual 4) Allow user override via quality_assess after the fact. This is low effort (1-2 days) with medium-high impact.
