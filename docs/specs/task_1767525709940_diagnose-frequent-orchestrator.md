## Problem Statement

watchdog.log shows many restarts and repeated "Orchestrator failed to start!" without a root-cause message. Improve watchdog/orchestrator startup diagnostics: capture exit code + stderr, persist last failure reason, and distinguish intentional shutdown vs crash. Goal: reduce restart churn and make failures actionable.
