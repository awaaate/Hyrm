## Problem Statement

Create patterns for agents to collaborate on complex tasks: 1) Task decomposition - split large tasks into subtasks 2) Result aggregation - combine results from multiple workers 3) Review patterns - one agent reviews another's work. Document in multi-agent-patterns skill.

**Additional Context**:
- [2026-01-01T21:47:43.691Z] Added 6 new collaboration patterns to multi-agent-patterns skill: 1) Task Decomposition - split complex tasks into subtasks 2) Result Aggregation - collect and merge worker results 3) Review Pattern - peer review between agents 4) Consensus Pattern - multi-agent voting 5) Checkpoint Pattern - save/resume progress 6) Pipeline Pattern - chain agents in sequence. Also added Anti-Patterns section.

## Goals

- Complete high-priority work to unblock downstream tasks
- Design comprehensive solution with proper error handling and documentation
- Verify changes with tests and ensure no regressions

---

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Analysis**
  - Review task requirements and acceptance criteria
  - Identify dependencies and related systems
  - Plan approach and document assumptions

**Phase 2: Design & Specification**
  - Create detailed design document or architecture notes
  - Validate approach with team/orchestrator
  - Prepare for incremental implementation

**Phase 3: Implementation**
  - Implement primary changes
  - Write tests for new functionality
  - Handle edge cases and error scenarios

**Phase 4: Integration & Validation**
  - Integrate with existing systems
  - Run full test suite
  - Code review and address feedback

**Phase 5: Verification & Documentation**
  - Verify changes in target environment
  - Update documentation and comments
  - Create PR/commit with clear messages
