## Prompt Patterns to Study

### From Anthropic's Guidelines
1. **Be specific and direct** - Clear instructions produce better results
2. **Use examples** - Show the model what you want
3. **Think step by step** - Break complex tasks into stages
4. **Assign a role** - Give the model a persona
5. **Use XML tags** - Structure inputs clearly
6. **Chain prompts** - Build complex workflows from simple steps

### Multi-Agent Patterns
1. **Orchestrator-Worker** - Central coordinator delegates to specialists
2. **Peer Review** - Agents validate each other's work
3. **Pipeline** - Sequential processing through specialized agents
4. **Consensus** - Multiple agents vote on decisions

## Scheduled Research Tasks

The orchestrator should periodically:
1. Check these resources for new content
2. Extract relevant techniques
3. Update prompts and patterns
4. Document learnings in memory/knowledge-base.json
