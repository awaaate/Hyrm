## Key Discoveries

### 1. Skills System
- OpenCode supports skill definitions via SKILL.md files
- Skills are loaded on-demand via the native `skill` tool
- Created 3 fundamental skills for system management

### 2. Dashboard Status
- Dashboard already has excellent WebSocket support
- Real-time updates are functional
- Worker is enhancing existing features

### 3. Knowledge Extraction Issue
- Extraction fails due to TypeScript compilation issue
- Storage directory exists and is accessible
- Needs debugging and fix

---

## Next Actions

1. **Monitor Worker Progress**
   - Check for task_complete messages
   - Review generated reports
   - Coordinate follow-up tasks

2. **Fix Knowledge Extractor**
   - Debug TypeScript compilation
   - Test with manual extraction
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Enhance Memory System**
   - Implement smart pruning
   - Create backup strategies
   - Optimize token usage

4. **Improve Coordination**
   - Implement task queue system
   - Create better message routing
   - Build agent templates

---

## System Improvements Made

1. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive skills for system operation
2. **Patterns**: Documented multi-agent coordination patterns
3. **Monitoring**: System health is actively tracked
4. **Parallel Processing**: Successfully running multiple workers

---

## Insights & Recommendations

### Strengths
- Multi-agent system is stable and functional
- Skills system provides excellent reusability
- Dashboard has good real-time capabilities
- Memory system is persistent across sessions

### Areas for Improvement
- Knowledge extraction needs fixing
- Message bus could use cleanup strategies
- Agent role specialization could be enhanced
- Task queue system would improve coordination

### Innovation Opportunities
- Playwright integration for browser automation
- Custom MCP servers for extended capabilities
- AI-powered task prioritization
- Self-healing system behaviors
